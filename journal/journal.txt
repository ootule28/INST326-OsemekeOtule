This week I used AI for some of the exercises in the assignment. When I say that I don't mean that I let it solve the problems for me. However for certain python functions that I wasn't familiar with like ".find()/.rfind()". I asked ChatGPT what those functions did and some examples of when they're used. It was good for quick learning and refreshing my mind on other terms. 
Week 2 I used Chat GPT to brainstorm ideas for my group porject in INST335. I also found a new way to use it for the excercises. If there was a code with an error and I didn't know why, then ChatGPT would explain what the code I wrote actualy accomplished.
Week 3 This week I used AI to prepare for the UMD Career Fair at the Hotel. I asked Gemini AI what best follow up questions to ask an employer after intrpducing yourself. It was very helpful and gave me insight on more htings to ask the employer. I also used ChatGPT to check my codes if there a continuous error that I couldn't solve.
